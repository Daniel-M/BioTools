##### PROJECT NAME:	CheReNE-lib (Chemical Reaction Networks Equations - library)  
##### STATUS:		On development

##### SHORT DESCRIPTION:  
C++ classes to manipulate strings containing information related to biochemical reaction networks,  
such as _A+B->C_. Using a set of strings as an input, the library parses the code to a set of  
differential equations to be solved using libraries as [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) or  
[boost::odenint](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0b1/libs/numeric/odeint/doc/html/index.html) 
This code is inherited from my old repository cppBioCheN(A transtional repository)

##### DESCRIPTION   
###### Introduction   
Dealing with Biochemical Reaction Networks (BcRN) can be exhausting. BcRN can be modeled by many 
means, one of them by the use of differential equations. There's the Michaelis-Menten approach,  
which could be derived form the differential equations that describe the network and apply equilibria   
criterion. When looking for the complete description of the BcRN, one must reduce the the assumptions  
made in order to get the more information that one can get.  
  
Using the differential equations approach, the analytical steps on deriving the set of equations   
for the BcRN takes lots of time. More when the model have to be changed or modified, the task becomes   
so exhausting. Given the fact that the differential equations can get so complex and the involved   
chemical species can get to high levels of coupling among the equations that describe the network,  
I found the need of developing a computational tool for deriving the differential equations, by now  
using the _mass action law_
